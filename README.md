# Chat2-124M Simple Implementation

This directory contains simplified implementations of the core concepts in the Chat2-124M project.
Each file focuses on the essential algorithm or technique without the overhead of a full implementation.

## Files

- `tokenizer.py`: A simplified byte-level tokenizer with basic BPE
- `model.py`: A minimal transformer implementation with core attention mechanisms
- `data.py`: Simple data loading and preprocessing utilities
- `train.py`: Basic training loop for language models
- `inference.py`: Core inference logic without API endpoints
- `evaluate.py`: Simple evaluation metrics

## Usage

These files are for educational purposes to understand the core concepts.
They are not intended for production use but can serve as a starting point
for implementing your own language model systems.
